Continuing on with our basic statistics lesson from last week, we will go down the flow chart in the other direction. What if we have a research question like the following:

**Research question 1**: Are fish lengths different between the MPA and the REF sites?

**Research question 2**: Are fish lengths different among MPAs from San Diego to Humboldt County?

# T-TEST

```{r guide, echo = F, fig.dim = c(6, 4), fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(here("Images", "stats_test_choose.png"))


```



Looking at the flowchart for Research Question 1: 

* Is the predictor variable categorical or quantitative?

* Is the response variable categorical or quantitative?

* How many groups are being compared?

* What kind of test should we use? 


    > T-Test!
    
More specifically we will use a two-sample t-test for our question. Let's get more specific with our question.

*Are fish length different between the MPA and REF sites at Point Buchon for Vermilion Rockfish (over the lifetime of CCFRP)?*

I queried the MS Access Database for all Vermilion Rockfish caught in PB from 2007-2022 (2023 not included for simplicity because of differences in how we measured fishes starting that season). I included area, site, year, length, species - then I am going to narrow down the focus of the data frame so we can use it for our second research question.

```{r raw data}

raw_dat <- read_csv(here("Data", "t_test_anova.csv"))

## check out the data structure
str(raw_dat)

raw_dat_str <- raw_dat %>%
  mutate(trip = as.factor(trip),
         drift = as.factor(drift),
         area = as.factor(area),
         year = as.factor(year),
         site = as.factor(site),
         fish_id = as.factor(fish_id),
         species = as.factor(species))

head(raw_dat_str, 4)

```

Transform the data to be more informative to our research question (filter for different parameters; only select columns we are interested in)

```{r research question 1 data transformation}

## data for research question 1
data_rq_1 <- raw_dat_str %>%
  filter(!year == 2023,
         area == "PB",
         species == "VER") %>%
  select(site, year, species, length_cm)

head(data_rq_1)

```

## Investigation & Assumption Checking

Let's do a quick investigative visuals and check assumptions before we continue with the stats

```{r investigation and assumptions}

## equal variance

boxplot(data_rq_1$length_cm ~ data_rq_1$site)

bartlett.test(length_cm ~ site, data = data_rq_1) 

## doesn't have equal variance

## normality

hist(data_rq_1$length_cm)

shapiro.test(data_rq_1$length_cm) 


## hmm not normal


## independence

## no good way to check this... but if you used a randomized sampling design (which we did!) you can assume a good amount of independence



```



It looks like there is a difference between the length of Vermilion Rockfish in the MPA and the REF site... is it statistically different? Let's find out.

## T-Test Hypothesis Testing

Null hypothesis or H~0~ : There is NO difference in length of Vermilion Rockfish between the MPA and the REF site. Another way to say this: the true difference in means between MPA and REF is 0.

Alternative hypothesis or H~a~: There is a difference in length of Vermilion Rockfish between the MPA and the REF site. Another way to say this: the true difference in means between MPA and REF is not 0.

**REMEMBER** a small p-value will indicate more evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis (we reject the null hypothesis), which means there is a difference, while a large p-value will indicate that we don't have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis, which means there is no statistical difference that we can prove with our data.

```{r t test}

t_test_length <- t.test(length_cm ~ site, data = data_rq_1)

t_test_length

## anoter way to check for normality
# qqnorm(data_rq_1$length_cm)
# qqline(data_rq_1$length_cm)



```

   > Conclusion: We have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a difference in mean length of Vermilion Rockfish between the Point Buchon MPA and REF sites.

## Visualization T-Test
     
Now let's practice making a better looking visual

```{r t test visualization}

# data_rq_1_plot <- data_rq_1 %>%
#   group_by(site) %>%
#   mutate(se = std.error(length_cm))

ggplot(data = data_rq_1) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = site, y = length_cm, fill = site), color = "black")+
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Site", values = c( "#C83948", "darkblue"))+
  labs(x = "", y = "Length (cm)\n", title = "Vermilion Rockfish Length Comparison")+
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 12))



```


# ANOVA TIME

```{r echo = F, fig.dim = c(6, 4), fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(here("Images", "stats_test_choose.png"))

```


Looking at the flowchart for Research Question 2: 

* Is the predictor variable categorical or quantitative?

* Is the response variable categorical or quantitative?

* How many groups are being compared?

* What kind of test should we use? 

     > ANOVA
     
*Are fish length different in MPAs from San Diego to Humboldt for Vermilion Rockfish?*
     

```{r research question 2 data transformation}

data_rq_2 <- raw_dat_str %>%
  filter(species == "VER",
         !year == 2023,
         site == "MPA") %>%
  select(area, site, year, species, length_cm)

```

## Investigation & Assumption Checking

Let's do a quick investigative visual and check our assumptions before we continue with the stats

```{r}
## equal variance

boxplot(data_rq_2$length_cm ~ data_rq_2$area)

bartlett.test(length_cm ~ area, data = data_rq_2) ## doesn't have equal variance

## normality

hist(sqrt(data_rq_2$length_cm))

shapiro.test(sqrt(data_rq_2$length_cm)) ## hmm not normal

## independence

## no good way to check this... but if you used a randomized sampling design (which we did!) you can assume a good amount of independence

```
 > "In general, a one-way ANOVA is considered to be fairly robust against violations of the normality [and equal variance] assumption as long as the sample sizes are sufficiently large. "


A little messier, but it looks like there are some differences visually AT LEAST between some groups


## ANOVA Hypothesis Testing

Null hypothesis or H~0~ : There are NO difference in length of Vermilion Rockfish between any of the areas. Another way to say this: the true difference in means between all the areas is 0.

Alternative hypothesis or H~a~: There is a difference in length of Vermilion Rockfish between the MPA and the REF site. Another way to say this: the true difference in means between MPA and REF is not 0.

```{r}

anova_model <- aov(length_cm ~ area, data = data_rq_2)

summary(anova_model)

#plot(anova_model, 2) ## another check for normality after model is made

```
   > Conclusion: We have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a difference in mean length of Vermilion Rockfish in at least one area.

Okay there is at least one area with a difference in Vermilion Rockfish Length... but where is the difference?

## Post Hoc Testing

```{r}

post_hoc_test <- TukeyHSD(anova_model)

post_hoc_test



```

## Visualization ANOVA
     

```{r anova visualization, fig.dim = c(8, 4), fig.align='center'}


data_rq_2$area <- factor(data_rq_2$area, levels=c("CM", "TM", "SP", "BH", "AN", "PL", "BL", "PB", "CP", "AI", "SW","LJ"))

ggplot(data = data_rq_2) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = area, y = length_cm, fill = area), color = "black")+
  labs(x = expression("Area from North" %->%South), y = "Length (cm)\n", title = "Vermilion Rockfish Length Comparison")+
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 12))+
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="CCFRP Area"))



```
